# Overview

This project implements the following :
- **A fully controllable camera :** camera moves in all directions by pressing different keys.
- **Creates plane and shapes of different structure**: takes input from a file and draws spheres, triangle, quadric surface and a floor(2d plane).
- **Illumination with the Phong Lighting Model** : computes the ambient, specular and diffuse component of each object and light them accordingly.
- **Recursive Reflection** : reflection is computed recursively for an object according to the variable `recursion_level`.

# Language & Library Used
- `CPP`, `OpenGL`
